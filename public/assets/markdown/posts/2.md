I am a big fan of the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor. It has become the tool of choice for work and play. During my course work though, I had the opportunity to work with both Visual Studio and Xcode IDEs. I never felt completely at home with Visual Studio. A classmate did remark fondly on their experience coding in C# with Visual Studio, but for our C++ assignments, I found myself consistently drifting back to Atom. With the iOS development course, I put in the time to learn the Xcode and feel that I did reach a certain level of synergy.

With iOS development, Apple offers both visual and code methods for developing an app and its interface. Using a combination of the two is probably best. The following tutorial will start with two views and demonstrate how to prompt an alert for the user with choices when they tap a button (handy if you are confirming a deletion of a kind), and then segue from one view to another, passing data in the process.

We start with two view controller scenes in the story board, each linked to their own view controller swift file. The first one possesses a button aptly labeled **GO TO B**.

Now, Xcode will allow you to create a quick segue to the latter scene by holding down control, clicking on the button element and then dragging across to the destination scene. For this example though, we want to do a little more and so we will create a manual segue. To do so, we can hold down control, click on the View Controller element in the list to the left, and then drag it to View Controller element for the destination scene, choosing the **Show** type of segue.

With the manual segue created, it is a good idea to specify a name for it. Having brought up the attributes inspector for the segue in top right, we specify its identifier as **goToB**.

Before moving to the code, we will bring the button into the view controller swift file for that first scene. Having brought up the assistant editor to get both the story board and the swift file showing, we can again hold down control, click on the button in the storyboard scene and then drag it over to the code area.

We will set the connection to **Action** and the name to **respondToGoToBButton**. This will generate the following code.

    @IBAction func respondToGoToBButton(sender: AnyObject) {}

To enable segue in respond to a tap of that button, you can modify the code with the performSegueWithIdentifier method to use the manual segue that we setup earlier.

    @IBAction func respondToGoToBButton(sender: AnyObject) {
      self.performSegueWithIdentifier("goToB", sender: self)
    }


We will now modify this code to present the user with an alert where they can confirm if they wish to proceed. It will use the UIAlertController and will have two actions, the first of which ("Yes") will lead to the segue.


    @IBAction func respondToGoToBButton(sender: AnyObject) {
      let confirmAlert = UIAlertController(title: "segueExample", message: "Are you sure you wish to proceed?", preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert)

      confirmAlert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Yes", style: .Default, handler: { (action: UIAlertAction!) in
        self.performSegueWithIdentifier("goToB", sender: self)
      }))

      confirmAlert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "No", style: .Default, handler: { (action: UIAlertAction!) in
      }))

      presentViewController(confirmAlert, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

The final task is to pass some data to the second view controller. To illustrate this we will start by adding a string variable to that second controller and a print command in the viewDidLoad method to display the string. The code for that second controller is as follows.

    import UIKit
    class BViewController: UIViewController {
      var receivedData: String = ""

      override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        print(receivedData)
      }

      override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
      }
    }

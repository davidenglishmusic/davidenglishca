I discovered the [Movies In Color](http://moviesincolor.com/) website a while back. It offers colour palettes for still shots from various films and tv shows. At the time I considered using those palettes for certain web projects.

At last week's [VanRuby Group Hack Night](http://www.meetup.com/vancouver-ruby/), I tasked myself with creating a program to achieve a similar result. I called it Matisse, after the [celebrated painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse) known for his use of colour. Ruby's ever handy Image Magick gem, [RMagick](https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick), simplified the job. It has a quantize method which easily determines the most commonly used colors. Having sorted the resulting hash from darkest to brightest, the program concludes by drawing out the palette. Here is an example with [Emily Carr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Carr)'s Vanquished:

As an interesting comparison, I took some of the stills found on Movies in Color and ran then through the program. They did produce slightly different palettes so I assume there is some difference in the algorithm. In any case, [here is a link to the repository.](https://github.com/davidenglishmusic/matisse)
